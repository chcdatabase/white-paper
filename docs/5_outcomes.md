## Overview of Initial Goals

The initial grant proposed to meet the following goals:
1. Create an initial database with over 400,000 data points
2. Produce an online data entry system that allows for streamlined data entry, and
3. Produce a fully functioning web application which will allow the public to interact with the data from the database.

As will be seen, Goals 1 and 3 were not only met but surpassed in every measure. The overarching intention of Goal 2 was met, however, the form needed to be adjusted for the sake of cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

## Goal 1: The Database

By combining the data produced prior to the grant period with the data collected during the grant period, the CHCD surpassed its initial goal of having a database with over 400,000 data points. In its initial release, the database is comprised of:
1.  44,979 Nodes
   - 33,900 People
   - 6,488 Institutions
   - 1,155 Corporate Entities
   - 130 Events
   - 1,306 Geographic Locations
2. 208,237 Relationships
3. 1,916,717 Properties

This large number of nodes, relationships, and properties allows users of the database to create queries to study a diverse number of religious groups in China, and can be combined with other datasets to understand how Christianity affected historical happenings in China. The sources utilized to create this dataset are documented in the image below.

## Outcome 3

Graph databases mimic the natural relationships that exist in the real world; their structures often look like what you might draw on a white board when trying to describe how things are related. It is helpful to keep this basic framework in mind when devising spreadsheets for data collection.
