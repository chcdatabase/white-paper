# Project Continuation

---

## Future Goals

The project team has already identified key avenues for continuing the work of the project in the ensuing months and years.

### Data Collection
With a few notable exceptions, the current dataset lean heavily on Western and Protestant sources. In addition several major religious groups are still missing almost entirely from the database. Thus, the project team has identified several major groups and sources which will populate the next major update to the database. In no particular order, these groups are:
* Chinese Literati
* Chinese Protestant Pastors
* Franciscans
* Dominicans
* Lazarists
* SVD Missionaries
* Protestant Missionaries (pre-1900)
* Educational Facilities

Data collection on many of these groups is already ongoing thanks to the support of private donors and internal institutional funding at Boston University.

### Data Quality
In the final stages of cleaning, several endemic issues were noted throughout the database, such as accidental merges of people with similar names. While these do not take-away from the overarching usefulness of the data, correcting these issues would provide a more useful dataset and better user experience. Eliminating these issues would be an ideal avenue for collaboration with a data science lab or department.

### Scholarship Production

Going forward, the project team would like to strike a balance between large scale data collection and scholarly production. With the release of the initial dataset, the project team has begun to pursue research questions related to the database with the goal of publishing findings in peer-reviewed journals. In addition, the team is currently submitting a grant proposal for funding that would enable further data collection and the production of a scholarly edited volume made up of scholarship which utilizes the database.

### Web Application Development

The CHCD online platform will require ongoing maintenance and development. The partnership with Anderson University will provide one of the main sources for this work, especially in relation to the "data" view of the web application. The CHCD team hopes that these sort of partnerships will make up a greater portion of their collaborative efforts going forward.

## Looking Ahead

These far-reaching goals will sustain a good portion of the project team's research agenda for many years to come. Yet, our partners' and collaborators' dedication to the CHCD has demonstrated that there is an excitement about the pedagogical and research potential of the project. As the CHCD ventures into it's next phase, the project team hopes that the project continues to inspire excitement about Chines History and the often-ignored role that religion had in it.
