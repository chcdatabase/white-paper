## Achievement & Impact

With the completion of the grant period, the CHCD has achieved all the stated goals of the grant project. As a digital humanities project, the technical achievements of the project team are straightforward:

1. A large database running on cutting-edge graph technology,
2. A JavaScript web application built to industry standards, and
3. The largest dataset on historical Christianity in China in existence.

Together, these technological achievements constitute an innovative digital humanities project that blends the best of the humanities, newer developments in database technology, and the world of application development.

Having achieved the main goals of the project, the CHCD’s larger impact on the fields of Chinese History, Global History and World Christianity will be only clearly ascertained well after the grant-period is over. At the same time, several research groups have already expressed interest in using the initial dataset for their own research agendas. As an initial entry into this future body of scholarship, the project team is currently formulating several research questions which could be answered using data from the database. To measure future impact, the project team will use Google Analytics to monitor the use of the project website and online platform. We will also be monitoring publications, presentations at academic conferences, and citations.

Regardless of what the future holds, the work accomplished during the grant period provided valuable lessons for the future and demonstrated that there is a remarkable amount of interest in the long-term goals of the project. Three notable learnings rise to the surface.

First, we recognized the necessity of diverse partnerships in developing large humanities projects. The project would have been impossible without the contributions of partners of all kinds. Stakeholders ranged from researchers with overlapping interests, to volunteer Chinese Christians interested in their own history, or undergraduate data science students who wanted to apply their skillsets to a novel problem. These diverse partnerships required a good deal of management but demonstrate the potential value and intersectional appeal that digital humanities projects can have. When they are mutually enriching, digital humanities projects can be “co-owned” by a diverse body of stakeholders.

Second, we recognized the need for a “canonical” approach in large-scale data collection. Any historical dataset will be necessarily incomplete, yet data visualizations produced from such datasets can mask this incompleteness. Through the course of data collection and application development, the project team recognized the need to find some standard measure by which to measure the relative completeness of data being collected. As such, data was collected only when a clear corpus or “canon” could be identified which contained the desired historical information. This produced a dataset with nodes and relationships that were more or less parallel with one another and which future researchers could identify as a clear unit of analysis.

Third, we grappled with the need for data literacy in the digital humanities. Citizens of modern, technology-dependent societies are constantly surrounded and affected by algorithms and data science. We are humans in a digital world. Yet, as the project progressed we found that very few students in the humanities had the skillsets needed to accomplish many of the data-forward tasks needed for the project. Student workers and volunteers who came from non-humanities fields like data science, engineering, or business were often far better prepared to work on the project. While the interest of non-humanities students bodes well for the continued importance and appeal of humanistic questions, it does not bode well for the humanities in general. The task to create students who can answer inquiries about the human condition in the digital world demands that humanities programs invest in developing the skillsets needed to properly frame the question. To that end, digital humanities projects like the CHCD can provide a much-needed avenue for skillset training and data literacy development.

All these broader learnings are useful for informing the future stages of the project and the discipline of digital humanities as a whole.

## Challenges

The major challenges encountered were wholly related to the wide-range of skillsets necessary to accomplish the project. As a digital, historical project on Christianity in China, the project required expertise in multiple languages (specifically Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, and Latin), familiarity with modern and pre-modern ecclesial administration and nomenclature, data science skills (notably data cleaning and database management), and web application development. This broad range of skillsets could only be achieved through the recruitment of key team members and the formation of many diverse partnerships.
