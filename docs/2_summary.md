## Summary

"The China Historical Christian Database: Mapping the Spatial and Social Networks of Christianity in China, 1550-1950" is a project that was generously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (September 1, 2021 - August 31, 2022). The China Historical Christian Database (CHCD) is hosted by the [Center for Global Christianity and Mission](https://www.bu.edu/cgcm/) at Boston University.

The CHCD is a project that quantifies and visualizes the place of Christianity in modern China (1550-1950). The CHCD records Christian organizations, events, institutions, people, and the relationships that tied them all together. This information can be used to create spatial maps and relational networks that reveal the complex cultural exchange which took place between China and the world in the modern period. This project is the largest historical dataset on Christianity in China and breaks new ground in providing quantifiable data about modern Sino-Western relations.

More than a dataset, however, the CHCD team has also developed an online platform that allows users of all technical capabilities to explore connections in the database. The platform's intuitive interface is available in English and Chinese, and it enables the generation of visualizations, lists, and maps for use by the general public, students and teachers in secondary education and colleges.
