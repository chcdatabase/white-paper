# Project Background

## Origins

In 2017, Alex Mayfield asked, “What could someone learn if Pentecostal missionaries, who were highly mobile actors in Hong Kong, were put on a map?” He addressed the question to Eugenio Menegon in a directed study course and, because Mayfield had the technical skills and Menegon the background in Digital Humanities, the answer was born digitally. Using over a thousand Pentecostal periodicals, Mayfield tracked the movements and activities of Pentecostal actors in Hong Kong. The addresses of their homes, chapels, orphanages, and the like were recorded, along with the names, nationalities, and gender of each Pentecostal. The result produced 4,905 different people, ministries, and locations, and generated a thick web of 33,355 relationships connecting them. This dense network was used to quantitatively illustrate that Pentecostals were heavily invested in institution building, valued education, worked cooperatively with governmental bodies and across denominational boundaries, and avoided densely populated areas. These trends all cut across standard historical narratives that have treated the growth of global Pentecostalism as a sectarian, other-worldly outcome of global urbanization and modern industrial anomie.

## Scaling Up
Daryl Ireland, the Associate Director at Boston University’s Center for Global Christianity and Mission(CGCM) recognized that this approach could have far-reaching implications. If a relatively small sample could produce such new insights, what could be learned if the sample was and expanded to include all of Christianity over a 400 year period? At that scale, could a person see what role Christians and their institutions played in the formation of modern China? D, was intrigued. Such a question aligned with the Center’s research focus and overlapped with his own expertise. Ireland, Mayfield, and Menegon agreed to expand the original project into the CHCD, making it an initiative of the CGCM in 2018.

The challenge was how to proceed. Thus, the CGCM applied for and received a $5,526 grant that came with three months of consultation and software development from Boston University’s Software and Application Innovation Lab. In 2019, those funds built the proof-of-concept version of the CHCD, which focused on one province in China: Shanxi. An additional $6,000 from the CGCM allowed a cohort of graduate and undergraduate students to work alongside Ireland, Mayfield, and Menegon as they scraped data points from sources in French, Latin, English, Chinese, and Swedish. Although limited, this beta product proved capable of inspiring enthusiasm. Soon after, the CHCD team formed formal partnerships to furtehr the aims of the project. Notable partners include the Institute of Qing History at Renmin University, the Ricci Institute for Chinese-Western Cultural History at Boston College, the University of Naples "L'Orientale", and Whitworth University, among others.

## Preparing for the Future
Before building a full database and user-friendly web interface, the CHCD team understood the necessity of getting input from potential users. With generous financial support from Boston University’s Institute on Culture, Religion, & World Affairs, the BU Center for the Study of Asia, and the Institute of Qing History at Renmin University, Eugenio Menegon, Daryl Ireland, Xian LIU, and Alex Mayfield hosted, “Mapping Christianity in China, 1550-1950: Developing Relational and Geospatial Tools for the Study of Christianity in China.”  The virtual event brought together twenty academics and archivists as presenters from four continents to provide input and feedback on the CHCD on November 19-21, 2020. They evaluated the current data sets, thought about what is missing, and explained how they foresee using the database and web interface, so that the final product can be responsive to the needs of end-users like themselves. This online event attracted 266 scholars from 28 countries, showing the pent-up energy in the field and the need for this digital initiative.
